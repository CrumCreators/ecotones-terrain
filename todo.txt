# Biomes
* Plateau biomes?
* Heathland
* Bayou
* Everglades
* Steppe -> something unique
* Forest with balloon-y trees (see misc entry)
* Lowlands with jungle bush-like shrubs
* Kauri forest
* Mixed forest
* Lake biomes
* Rivers
* Different beach types
* Inland oceans
* Coastal biome variants
* Sequoia forest
* Larch forest
* Rice Field
* Gravelly desert
* Rocky desert
* Stone Spires (basically the ending fight area of Avatar lmao)

# Blocks and items
* More flower types
* Aquatic plants
* Implement curly grass
* Biome color based clover & wildflowers
* Berry Bushes
* Sap block
* Sap mob trap
* Acorns -> grow large trees
* Birch seeds -> grow large birch trees

# Misc
* Stop procrastinating on cold biomes
* Balloon-y tree with edges hanging off (this is very hard to describe in text)
* Add all biomes to lang file
* Move swamps to special biomes
* Take another look at well carvers
* Add roofed forest alternative
* Variants for the newly added biomes
* Fallen logs for every biome
* Add edge biomes to everything
* Burned village for dead spruce forests

* Improve the look of a few biomes (remove shrubs, more unique features, etc.)
* Sugarcane feature in fertile valley
* Better mod compat, deffered register system
* Tweak biome weights
* Beehives in other biomes

# Improved terrain
* Change shrubs to grow more frequently in medium quality areas
* Change shrubs to grow shorter when under trees
* Trees create podzol, maybe?
* Surrounding chunks influence chunk data
* Possion Disk Sampling
* look into Adaptive Incremental Stippling (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ab10b9)
* Improve branching algorithm (cellular automata? L-systems?)
* Different tree species
* Fruit trees
* Leaf generation variations
* Abstract the shit out of tree gen
* Special tree generation items (acorn, birch seed)
* Trees don't set block to dirt
