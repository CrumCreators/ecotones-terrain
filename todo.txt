* Change shrubs to grow more frequently in medium quality areas
* Change shrubs to grow shorter when under trees
* Trees create podzol, maybe?
* Surrounding chunks influence chunk data
* Possion Disk Sampling

* Improve branching algorithm (cellular automata? L-systems?)
* Different tree species
* Fruit trees
* Leaf generation variations
* Abstract the shit out of tree gen
* Special tree generation items (acorn, birch seed)
