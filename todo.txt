# Biomes
* Plateau biomes?
* Heathland
* Moor
* Bayou
* Everglades
* Chaparral
* Steppe -> something unique
* Forest with balloon-y trees (see misc entry)
* Lowlands with jungle bush-like shrubs
* Kauri forest
* Weird Desert (lots of tall cacti)
* Mixed forest
* Lake biomes
* Rivers
* Different beach types
* Inland oceans
* Coastal biome variants
* Palm forest
* Bluebell wood

# Blocks and items
* More flower types
* Aquatic plants
* Implement curly grass
* Biome color based clover & wildflowers
* Berry Bushes
* Sap block
* Sap mob trap
* Acorns -> grow large trees
* Birch seeds -> grow large birch trees

# Misc
* Stop procrastinating on cold biomes
* Steal zoerestria Bluff
* Balloon-y tree with edges hanging off (this is very hard to describe in text)
* Add all biomes to lang file
* Move swamps to special biomes
* Take another look at well carvers
* Add roofed forest alternative
* Variants for the newly added biomes
* Fallen logs for every biome

# Improved terrain
* Change shrubs to grow more frequently in medium quality areas
* Change shrubs to grow shorter when under trees
* Trees create podzol, maybe?
* Surrounding chunks influence chunk data
* Possion Disk Sampling
* look into Adaptive Incremental Stippling (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ab10b9)
* Improve branching algorithm (cellular automata? L-systems?)
* Different tree species
* Fruit trees
* Leaf generation variations
* Abstract the shit out of tree gen
* Special tree generation items (acorn, birch seed)
