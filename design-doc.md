# Ecotones Design Document
The basis of Ecotones' design is that every part of the world be different and unique, every time.
No 2 forests should ever look or feel the same, even if they're of the same biome.

When creating a new biome, it's important to have a core theme that the biome is based around.
Many of the older biomes fail to have this theme, and so they feel soulless.
Good examples of what I'm talking about: the Steppe, Tropical Grassland, Lush forest, Cool Shrubland, Cool Steppe, and the Temperate Rainforest.
They are all eerily similar to existing biomes, which leads to the question- is their inclusion in the mod justified? I think not.
Anyways. The theme of the biome doesn't need to be very unique- It just needs to be good enough that it doesn't feel forced or excessive.

Now, to decorate the biomes. Let's start with the basic shape. Most biomes have much more terrain variance than you'd see in vanilla- that's to ensure the biome doesn't
ever feel boring. It's not the best way to do that, but it's a good start. By letting the noise take over the landscape (through scale and volatility)
more strongly than vanilla minecraft, it makes the terrain feel more "alive", at least to me. Let's take a look at foliage now. Most Ecotones biomes re-use the basic setup
for foliage- shrubs, oak trees, and dead trees. For the most part, this is a good start. Ecotones biomes aren't designed to look very visually distinct; in fact they're
created using many of the same parts, partly because I'm lazy and partly because I want to invoke a feeling of "familiar, yet different" whenever you walk into a new biome.
Each biome should be distinct enough for the player to realize that they're new, but not distinct enough that they feel out of place, or unlike another biome in the mod.

Now comes the part where I analyze my own design decisions over the past year-ish, and try to figure out where it is that I've went wrong. In short: this mod is a total disaster.
Why? It's because it suffers from Even I Don't Know What It Should Be syndrome. There was no bigger goal to the design of the biomes and the world gen. For the most part, there
still isn't. I'm hoping to fix that with this document. Let's start at the very beginning. Ecotones, as a concept, was essentially based around this one image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661297992292106240/661428285720363039/unknown.png
That one image was probably the downfall of the mod, even though it pioneered it. At the start, I knew that I wanted to create something that captured the feeling of "familiar yet different".
But, where did it go wrong? When the biomes felt like they had an obligation to exist, instead of existing because they looked good or added something valuable to the world.
Remember those 6 biome examples that I talked about in the 2nd paragraph? those are all based on this image, and therefore they exist because they *need* to, not because they look good.
They are the weakest link the design of the Ecotones. At this point, I don't even know what I'm trying to get at here. Don't be like me, and don't lock your design into biomes that exist
out of obligation, instead make biomes that fit in cohesively. Better yet, make a design document so you know how all your puzzle pieces will fit together! I wish I had made this document a year ago.
If you've gotten this far, thanks for sticking with me. Take care, and I hope this helped someone.
