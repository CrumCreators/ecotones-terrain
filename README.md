# Ecotones

Ecotones is an overhaul mod for Minecraft that adds over 70 unique biomes and over 200 in total in a custom world type, as well as many new things to do.
Ecotones aims to improve the natural feeling of the world by taking inspiration from the real world, so no matter where you go in a world it'll always feel different,
even if it's within the same biome.
