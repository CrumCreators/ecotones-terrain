Ecotones creates biomes based on factors such as humidity, temperature, elevation, and soil drainage. When put together, these factors create a lot of unique biomes! Ecotones currently adds 27 biomes with many variants. It replaces the vanilla generator so it's currently not compatible with any other biome mod.
